# Building your first Sigfox connected prototype
*Learn how to build your own Sigfox-connected device with a devkit and a couple of components*

Introduction
----
The goal of this repo is to learn how to build a real-life application using Sigfox and Sens'it.  
Learn everything you need to know about Sigfox's technology, its advantages and its limitations. Then use that to build whatever you can imagine with the open hardware, firmware and software that is out there.  
You can learn it in just a couple of days!

Sigfox

### The Technology
Sigfox is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) complementing existing networks to address the bulk of connected objects.  
Sigfox invented a Radio Protocol and used it to build a global network adapted to small data transactions (like the ones generated by objects). Sigfox does not build IoT solutions or sell chipsets. Other IoT networks, like LoRa, exist.

</p>

Sigfox's network enables your everyday object to send data captured by its sensors.  
The data can then be processed and give new insights on optimizable processes.  
However, it is important to understand that the payload (data) that can be sent over Sigfox's network is limited in:  
* size (maximum 12 bytes) - this is intrinsic to how the LPWAN technology works, we will come back to that;
* frequency (140 messages a day max) - that is due to the fact that Sigfox uses a public radio frequency and cannot hog it
