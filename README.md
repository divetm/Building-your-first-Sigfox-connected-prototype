# Building your first Sigfox connected prototype
*Learn how to build your own Sigfox-connected device with a devkit and a couple of components*

Introduction
----
The goal of this repo is to learn how to build your own IoT device prototype using a Sigfox-connected devkit and a couple of components.  
If you've read [this repo](https://github.com/divetm/Getting-started-with-Sigfox) before, some of this might feel like a deja-vu. The idea is always to guide you from zero to a hundred. But, if you don't want to re-read something you already know, you can jump to [this section](#building-your-own-prototype).

  a. [The technology](#the-technology)  
  b. [Its limits and its advantages](#its-limits-and-its-advantages)  
  c. [The value chain](#the-value-chain)
